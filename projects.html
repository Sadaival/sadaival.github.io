                    This project include simulation of kortex robot (7 DOF) in Gazebo. The communication between various nodes is done through ROS (Robot Operating System). Codes are written for inverse kinematic and inverse dynamic controlers. The controller reads target end-effector positions and orientations. It makes a cubic-polynomial trajectory connecting these points and thereby does inverse kinematic calculation to output joint rotations for achieving the target pose.<!-- ...

                    This project was implemented on Efficycle (tadpole configuration hybrid vehicle). Efficycle is powered by two people manually and also a DC Motor. Bot these manual and electric powers are added to power the vehicle on a single shaft. As the torques/speed delivered by the motor and human effort are different, seperate gear ratio is required for both of them. The gear ratio of both the motor and human effort shaft needs to be changed according to current speed. An Arduino MEGA was used as a controller, to implement speed calculation, gear control and display unit. The speed is calculated using a hall effect sensor, which calculates the time difference between two magnetic impulses recieved through magnets on the rim of back wheel. Through this speed input the arduino defines the effecient gear ratio and signals two servo motors to individually push derailleurs of gears placed on human effort and motor shafts. A seprate joystick module is also provided to control gears manually if needed. The current gear positions and speed is displayed on the display unit fitted on efficyle. This project was presented in SAE Efficycle 2018 held in Jalandhar and recieved the 'Best Innovation Award'.

                    Formula Student is a global competition for engineering students to design racecars according to engineering specification provided. Our team participated in Formula Bharat 2020, and successfully designed and manufactured the vehicle. For this project I did the vehicle dynamics calculations for determining the initial parameters of the car and paticularly suspension subsystem. From this an iterative design process was used while incorporating all other subsystems with the suspension. Static and dynamic simulations, kinematic analysis was performed multiple times on suspension components. The suspension was manufactured to precision according to the final design and tested. As team captain I also worked in other subsystem design (steering, intake/exhaust, drivetrin, electronics, brake) and have a complete understanding of designing a formula student racecar.

                    Exploring the realm of computer vision, this project was catered for capturing the molten pool during weld deposition in metal additive manufacturing. Specialised cameras were procured, and an experimental setup was designed for collection of data. effecientnet model was trained for capturing the melt pool size to be used for control of input weld parameters.

                    This project explores the paper on uncertainty-aware self-ensembling, a semi-supervised learning method designed to improve 3D left atrium segmentation in medical imaging by Yu. L. et. al.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32245-8_67" target="_blank">view paper</a>. Using Monte Carlo Dropout and predictive entropy, the method incorporates uncertainty in the teacher-student model framework. The teacher provides uncertainty-aware segmentation targets to the student, which tries to learn only from the more confident regions. The approach is tested on the 3D MRI Left Atrium dataset by comparing the semi-supervised model to a fully supervised baseline, with more experiments assessing the effects of uncertainty and varying dropout rates. Modifications have been made to the training procedure by Yu. et. al. to accommodate for feasibility.

                    Traveling Salesman problem is an NP-hard optimisation problem in mathematics. But heurestic algorithms exists for solving it. Simialr heurestic algorithm of Lin-Kernighan was used to generate toolpath for use in additve manufacturing. The toolpath is of non-retractive nature and therefore has various benefits for WAAM (Wire arc additive manufacturing). A complete toolpath generation software was also made for this toolpath. the software took input of geometries and output G-codes for 3D printer. A part of this research work is published and further work on density based toolpath is in progress.

                    Powder bed deopsition is a critical step for Powbed bed fusion based additive manufacturing. Current method of using Doctor blade for recoater puts additonal stress on already deposited layers. A non-contact deposition method is desirable and therefore this project focussed on simulating a vibration based non-contact powder recoating system. Discrete elemnent method simulations were performed at various vibration frequency and recoater geometries to determine the optimal parameters.

                    The project aims to optimize the design of a morphing wing. A morphing wing proves to have better efficiency than a standard wing with ailerons and flaps. The three subsystems of aerodynamic performance, structural analysis and actuating mechanism are studied separately for optimization. The couplings between these subsystems transforms the problem into a multi-disciplinary design optimization problem. The focus of the current problems has been on designing a lightweight morphing wing which can provide for the lift requirement during different stages of flight (take-off, cruise, and landing); keeping in mind the torque requirements of the motors needed for the actuation of ribs. Sequential quadratic programming’s algorithm was used to perform the optimization of the morphing wing design. Many constraints pertaining to dimension restrictions, deformation of the wing and available power have been defined to limit the design space. The solving of the objective function for aerodynamics subsystems will require the computation of the lift coefficient for various aerofoil profiles for which x-foil solver is coupled with the optimisation codes.
